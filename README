Create a short:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5984/io/_design/io/_update/shorten?target=http://zombo.com/

You should see:

  Shortened to yvHa

Get the redirect:

http://127.0.0.1:5984/io/_design/io/_show/long/yvHa

For maximum effect, deploy behind an HTTP proxy that aliases / to http://127.0.0.1:5984/io/_design/io/_show/long/
